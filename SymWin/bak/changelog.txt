changes:

typos (missing/extra commas)
2nd (Caps) cent symbol was missing
ditched hebrew; too bizarre with cursor direction swapping
new icon 1 (need new icon 2, as white line looks rubbish at 16px)
ditched emojis, as they're not supported
Duplicated umlaut letters to colon key
Duplicated ^ circumflex letters to 6/^ key
Added Romanian comma-accented letters ă ș ț (pre-1904 ĭ ŭ ĕ d̦ not included), duplicated to comma key

Moved bullet point to Key.OemMinus (this is the minus/underscore key) from Key.Subtract, where I'd erroneously put it.
