- tried to add @ ', didn't work
Missing keys: numpad enter, @'
- divided keys into groups according to keyboard location within the code
Added weird keys and tested that they all work well :D
- added F1-F12, Numpad numbers, Numlock keys, empty (no idea what should go there)
- Numpad Add: equals
- Space: back/forward slashes, underscore, dash, interpunct (woulda put full stop/period there, but it looked too confusing
- Arrows: arrow symbols (also on Numpad 8246)

- Numpad divide now has backslash, Numpad subtract now has underscore 

because that's where US keyboards show it:
3 now has #
2 now has @

This is not true: put different chars all you want
// Note: Don't try to put different characters for upper and lower case, otherwise you'll get: "Invalid letter definition, unequal lower and upper case sequence length or length 0."

Bug: takes a long time to quit. RAM usage may have gone up???

duped a bunch of symbols, degree, paragraph, typography, to top left key. Oem8 might be @???

bug: hash and @ don't show up on numbers 2 and 3 (this is due to settings files left behind in LocalAppData from previous tests)
